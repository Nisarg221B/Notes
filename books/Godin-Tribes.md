“Magic only happens in a spectator’s mind. Everything else is a distraction…. Methods for their own sake are a distraction.

the Sternins did was find the mom with the healthy kids. And then they helped the others in the village notice what she was doing.

It might be the most important practical idea in this entire book. — location: [1598]() ^ref-59196

What leaders do: they give people stories they can tell themselves. Stories about the future and about change. — location: [1640]() ^ref-9692
