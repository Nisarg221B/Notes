# The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, Violate Them at Your Own Risk
## Metadata
* Author: [[Al Ries, Jack Trout]]

## Highlights
It’s better to be first than it is to be better. It’s much easier to get into the mind first than to try to convince someone you have a better product than the one that did get there first. — location: [112]() ^ref-60045

---
People tend to stick with what they’ve got. If you meet someone a little better than your wife or husband, it’s really not worth making the switch, what with attorneys’ fees and dividing up the house and kids — location: [142]() ^ref-610

No two products are any similar than twins are. Yet twins often complain that the first of the two whom a person meets always remains their favorite, even though the person also gets to know the other one. People tend to stick with what they’ve got. If you meet someone a little better than your wife or husband, it’s really not worth making the switch, what with attorneys’ fees and dividing up the house and kids — location: [140]() ^ref-11573

One reason the first brand tends to maintain its leadership is that the name often becomes generic. Xerox, the first plain-paper copier, became the name for all plain-paper copiers. People will stand in front of a Ricoh or a Sharp or a Kodak machine and say, “How do I make a Xerox copy?” — location: [159]() ^ref-33773

---
Regardless of reality, people perceive the first product into the mind as superior. Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not products — location: [182]() ^ref-37414

If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in. — location: [197]() ^ref-20344

It’s better to be first in the mind than to be first in the marketplace. — location: [242]() ^ref-32906

The law of the mind follows from the law of perception. If marketing is a battle of perception, not product, then — location: [253]() ^ref-20504

If marketing is a battle of perception, not product, then the mind takes precedence over the marketplace. — location: [253]() ^ref-15514

The conventional solution to the problem is money. That is, the resources to design and build product or service organizations plus the resources to hold press conferences, attend trade shows, run advertisements, and conduct direct mail programs (chapter 22: The Law of Resources — location: [258]() ^ref-43975

---
Unfortunately, this gives rise to the perception that the answer to all marketing questions is the same: money. Not true. More money is wasted in marketing than in any other human activity (outside of govern-ment activities, of course — location: [260]() ^ref-59139

If you want to make a big impression on another person, you cannot worm your way into their mind and then slowly build up a favorable opinion over a period of time. The mind doesn’t work that way. You have to blast your way into the mind. The reason you blast instead of worm is that people don’t like to change their minds. Once they perceive you one way, that’s it. They kind of file you away in their minds as a certain kind of person. You cannot become a different person in their minds. — location: [273]() ^ref-62477

---
Truth and perception become fused in the mind, leaving no difference between the two. — location: [297]() ^ref-38737

---
you’re a better perceiver than someone else. Most people think they are better perceivers than others. They have a sense of personal infallibility. Their perceptions are always more accurate than those of their neighbors or friends. Truth and perception become fused in the mind, leaving no difference between the two. — location: [295]() ^ref-31414

---
People cling firmly to the belief that reality is the world outside of the mind and that the individual is one small speck on a global spaceship. Actually it’s the opposite. The only reality you can be sure about is in your own perceptions. If the universe exists, it exists inside your own mind and the minds of others. That’s the reality that marketing programs must deal with. — location: [303]() ^ref-29859

What makes the battle even more difficult is that 23 22 Laws of Marketing 10/31/02 12:23 PM Page 24 THE 22 IMMUTABLE LAWS OF MARKETING customers frequently make buying decisions based on second-hand perceptions. Instead of using their own perceptions, they base their buying decisions on someone else’s perception of reality. This is the “everybody knows” principle. — location: [353]() ^ref-7898

You can’t narrow the focus with quality or any other idea that doesn’t have proponents for the opposite point of view. You can’t position yourself as an honest politician, because nobody is willing to take the opposite position — location: [449]() ^ref-31243

Billboard, the bible of the music business, has 11 separate hit lists: classical, contemporary jazz, country, crossover, dance, Latin, jazz, pop, rap, rhythm and blues, and rock. And 11 leaders for the 11 categories. They recently included Itzhak Perlman, Four-play, Garth Brooks, Luciano Pavarotti, Michael Jackson, Mi Mayor Necesidad, Dave Grusin, Enya, Public Enemy, Vanessa Williams, and Bruce Springsteen. Each segment is a separate, distinct entity. Each segment has its own reason for existence. And each segment has its own leader, which is rarely the same as the leader of the original category. IBM is the leader in mainframes, DEC in minis, Sun in workstations, — location: [738]() ^ref-43057

Is alcohol a stimulant or a depressant? If you visit almost any bar and grill on a Friday night after work, you’d swear that alcohol was a stimulant. The noise and laughter are strong evidence of alcohol’s stimulating effects. Yet at 4:00 in the morning, when you see a few happy-hour customers sleep-ing it off in the streets, you’d swear that alcohol is a depressant. Chemically, alcohol is a strong depressant. But in the short term, by depressing a person’s inhibitions, alcohol acts like a stimulant. Many marketing moves exhibit the same phenomenon. The long-term effects are often the exact opposite of the short-term effects. — location: [793]() ^ref-2312

Sales
increase business in short term
but once thd customers are educated that the regular prices are too high , they tend to avoid the outlet unless its on sale, so the outlets are forced to keep sale on regular basis
in turn decreasing the business in long term

line extension is the easy way out. Launching a new brand requires not only money, but also an idea or concept. For a new brand to succeed, it ought to be first in a new category (chapter 1: The Law of Leadership). Or the new brand ought to be positioned as an alternative to the leader (chapter — location: [954]() ^ref-49527

IS line extension really that bad ?

There are three things to sacrifice: product line, target market, and constant change — location: [965]() ^ref-20585

The Law of Candor When you admit a negative, the prospect will give you a positive. — location: [1105]() ^ref-44608

---
one of the most effective ways to get into a prospect’s mind is to first admit a negative and then twist it into a positive. “Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars.” “With a name like Smucker’s, it has to be good.” “The 1970 VW will stay ugly longer.” “Joy. The most expensive perfume in the world.” — location: [1110]() ^ref-26893

---
First and foremost, candor is very disarming. Every negative statement you make about yourself is instantly accepted as truth. Positive statements, on the other hand, are looked at as dubious at best. Especially in an advertisement. You have to prove a positive statement to the prospect’s satisfaction. No proof is needed for a negative statement. — location: [1114]() ^ref-56825

---
The law of candor must be used careful-ly and with great skill. First, your “negative” must be wide-ly perceived as a negative. It has to trigger an instant agree-ment with your prospect’s mind. If the negative doesn’t register quickly, your prospect will be confused and will wonder, “What’s this all about?” Next, you have to shift quickly to the positive. The purpose of candor isn’t to apologize. The purpose of candor is to set up a benefit that will convince your prospect. — location: [1144]() ^ref-23738

So it is in marketing. Most often there is only one place where a competitor is vulnerable. And that place should be the focus of the entire invading force. — location: [1168]() ^ref-21692

the line of, least expectation.” — location: [1165]() ^ref-53089

---
One way to cope with an unpredictable world is to build an enormous amount of flexibility into your organization. As change comes sweeping through your category, you have to be willing to change and change quickly if you are to survive in the long term. — location: [1263]() ^ref-23962

---
When people become successful, they tend to become less objective. They often substitute their own judgment for what the market wants. — location: [1288]() ^ref-25646

---
Brilliant marketers have the ability to think like a prospect thinks. They put themselves in the shoes of their customers. They don’t impose their own view of the world on the situation. (Keep in mind that the world is all perception anyway, and the only thing that counts in marketing is the customer’s perception.) — location: [1309]() ^ref-7433

---
The bigger the company, the more likely it is that the chief executive has lost touch with the front lines. This might be the single most important factor limit-ing the growth of a corporation. — location: [1319]() ^ref-47610

---
The next thing to cut back on are the meetings. Instead of talking things over, walk out and see for yourself. As Gorbachev told Reagan, “It is better to see once than to hear a hundred times.” — location: [1344]() ^ref-13727

---
The Japanese seem to be able to admit a mistake early and then make the necessary changes. Their consensus management style tends to eliminate the ego. Since a large number of people have a small piece of a big decision, there is no stigma that can be considered career damaging. In other words, it’s a lot easer to live with “We were all wrong” than the devastating “I was wrong.” This egoless approach is a major factor in making the Japanese such relentless marketers. It’s not that they don’t make mistakes, but when they do, they admit them, fix them, and just keep coming — location: [1356]() ^ref-35432

---
Wal-Mart is different from many large corporations because, so far, it appears to be free of an insidious disease called the “personal agenda” that can creep into any corporation. Marketing decisions are often made first with the decision maker’s career in mind and second with the impact on the competition or the enemy in mind. There is a built-in conflict between the personal and the corporate agenda. — location: [1367]() ^ref-1653

---
When the senior executive has a high salary and a short time to retirement, a bold move is highly unlikely — location: [1371]() ^ref-7148

---
Nobody has ever been fired for a bold move they didn’t make. — location: [1373]() ^ref-32296

---
One way to defuse the personal agenda factor is to bring it out in the open. 3M uses the “champion” system to publicly identify the person who will benefit from the success of a new product or venture. — location: [1376]() ^ref-46295

---
Successful programs are not built on fads, they’re built on trends — location: [1461]() ^ref-62830

---
A fad is a wave in the ocean, and a trend is the tide. A fad gets a lot of hype, and a trend gets very little. Like a wave, a fad is very visible, but it goes up and down in a big hurry. Like the tide, a trend is almost invisible, but it’s very powerful over the long term. — location: [1463]() ^ref-21103

---
(A fashion, on the other hand, is a fad that repeats itself. Examples: short skirts for women and double-breasted suits for men. Halley’s Comet is a fashion because it comes back every 75 years or so.) — location: [1468]() ^ref-25427

---
You see this in the toy business. Some owners of hot toys want to put their hot toy name on everything. The result is that it becomes an enormous fad that is bound to collapse. When everybody has a Ninja turtle, nobody wants one anymore — location: [1479]() ^ref-37821

---
On the other hand, the Barbie doll is a trend. When Barbie was invented years ago, the doll was never heavily merchandised into other areas. As a result, the Barbie doll has become a long-term trend in the toy business. — location: [1482]() ^ref-40115

---
The most successful entertainers are the ones who control their appearances. They don’t overextend themselves. They’re not all over the place. They don’t wear out their welcome. Elvis Presley’s manager, Colonel Parker, made a deliberate attempt to restrict the number of appearances and records the King made. As a result, every time Elvis appeared, it was an event of enormous impact. — location: [1484]() ^ref-24262

---
One way to maintain a long-term demand for your product is to never totally satisfy the demand. — location: [1490]() ^ref-62755

---
Ideas without money are worthless. Well. . . not quite. But you have to use your idea to find the money, not the marketing help. The marketing can come later. — location: [1507]() ^ref-24209
