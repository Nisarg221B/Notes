# How to Avoid a Climate Disaster
## Metadata
* Author: [[Bill Gates]]

## Highlights
most people combine all the different greenhouse gases into a single measure known as “carbon dioxide equivalents.” (You — location: [379]() ^ref-48698

---
We use carbon dioxide equivalents to account for the fact that some gases trap more heat than carbon dioxide but don’t stay around as long. — location: [380]() ^ref-32480

---
many of these other gases cause more warming than carbon dioxide does—in the case of methane, 120 times more warming the moment it reaches the atmosphere. But methane doesn’t stay around as long — location: [376]() ^ref-8489

---
Why don’t all gases act this way? Because molecules with two copies of the same atom—for example, nitrogen or oxygen molecules—let radiation pass straight through them. Only molecules made up of different atoms, the way carbon dioxide and methane are, have the right structure to absorb radiation and start heating up. — location: [415]() ^ref-53708

---
There are two things we can do about it: Adaptation. We can try to minimize the impact of the changes that are already here and that we know are coming. Because climate change will have the worst impact on the world’s poorest people, and most of the world’s poorest people are farmers, adaptation is a major focus for the — location: [621]() ^ref-4888

---
research into new varieties of crops that tolerate the droughts and floods that will be more frequent and severe in the coming decades. I’ll explain more about adaptation and outline a few of the steps we’ll need to take in chapter 9. Mitigation. Most of this book isn’t about adaptation. It’s about the other thing we need to do: stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. To have any hope of staving off disaster, the world’s biggest emitters—the richest countries—have to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. Middle- income countries need to get there soon after, and the rest of the world will eventually need to follow suit. — location: [625]() ^ref-31098

---
The countries that build great zero-carbon companies and industries will be the ones that lead the global economy in the coming decades — location: [634]() ^ref-2343

---
In the past, we’ve moved from one source to another because the new one was cheaper and more powerful. When we stopped burning so much wood and started using more coal, for example, it was because we could get a lot more heat and light from a pound of coal than from a pound of wood. — location: [765]() ^ref-8838

It was a matter of economics, not the environment. — location: [769]() ^ref-36190

2. What’s Your Plan for Cement? If you’re talking about a comprehensive plan for tackling climate change, you need to consider everything that humans do to cause greenhouse gas emissions. — location: [940]() ^ref-31334

Watts are equivalent to “cups per second.” A — location: [971]() ^ref-43145

Whenever you hear “kilowatt,” think “house.” “Gigawatt,” think “city.” A hundred or more gigawatts, think “big country. — location: [994]() ^ref-60297

---
A nuclear plant runs 24 hours a day and is shut down only for maintenance and refueling. But the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine, so the effective capacity of plants powered by wind and solar panels might be 30 percent or less. On average, they’ll produce 30 percent of the gigawatt you need. That means you’ll need to supplement them with other sources to get one gigawatt reliably. Tip: Whenever you hear “kilowatt,” think “house.” “Gigawatt,” think “city.” A hundred or more gigawatts, think “big country. — location: [990]() ^ref-62840

---
4. How Much Space Do You Need? Some power sources take up more room than others. — location: [996]() ^ref-22973

---
Power density is the relevant number here. It tells you how much power you can get from different sources for a given amount of land (or water, if you’re putting wind turbines in the ocean). It’s measured in watts per square — location: [999]() ^ref-14175

---
If someone tells you that some source (wind, solar, nuclear, whatever) can supply all the energy the world needs, find out how much space will be required to produce that much energy. — location: [1012]() ^ref-60328

---
If you consume one kilowatt for an hour, you’ve used one kilowatt-hour. The typical U.S. household uses 29 kilowatt-hours a day. — location: [1250]() ^ref-40000

batteries. I’m using this illustration to make a crucial point: It’s extremely difficult and expensive to store electricity on a large scale, but that’s one of the things we’ll need to do if we’re going to rely on intermittent sources to provide a significant percentage of clean electricity in the coming years. And we’re going to need much more clean electricity in the coming — location: [1370]() ^ref-30819

---
Nuclear fission. Here’s the one-sentence case for nuclear power: It’s the only carbon-free energy source that can reliably deliver power day and night, through every season, almost anywhere on earth, that has been proven to work on a large scale. No other clean energy source even comes close to what nuclear already provides today. (Here I mean nuclear fission—the process of getting energy by splitting atoms apart. I’ll get to its counterpart, nuclear fusion, in the next section.) The United States gets around 20 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants; France has the highest share in the world, getting 70 percent of its electricity from nuclear — location: [1474]() ^ref-13181

---
Nuclear is the most efﬁcient, using much less material per unit of electricity generated than other sources — location: [1490]() ^ref-31215

---
Nuclear fusion. There’s another, entirely different approach to nuclear power that’s quite promising but still at least a decade away from supplying electricity to consumers. Instead of getting energy by splitting atoms apart, as fission does, it involves pushing them together, or fusing them. — location: [1530]() ^ref-1914

---
focuses on certain types of hydrogen—and get it extraordinarily hot, well over 50 million degrees Celsius, while it’s in an electrically charged state known as plasma. At these temperatures, the particles are moving so fast that they hit each other and fuse together, just as the hydrogen atoms in the sun do. When the hydrogen particles fuse, they turn into helium, and in the process they release a great deal of energy, which can be used to generate electricity. (Scientists have various ways of containing the plasma; the most common methods use either powerful magnets or lasers.) — location: [1533]() ^ref-33077

---
Fusion’s waste products would be radioactive for hundreds of years, versus hundreds of thousands for waste plutonium and other elements from fission, and at a much lower level—about as dangerous as radioactive hospital waste. There’s no chain reaction to run out of control, because the fusion ceases as soon as you stop supplying fuel or switch off the device that’s containing the plasma. — location: [1543]() ^ref-21773

---
The main type of hydrogen that’s usually used in fusion can be extracted from seawater, and there’s enough of it to meet the world’s energy needs for many thousands of — location: [1541]() ^ref-15515

---
Pumped hydro. This is a method of storing city-sized amounts of energy, and it works like this: When electricity is cheap (for example, when a stiff wind is turning your turbines really fast), you pump water up a hill into a reservoir; then, when demand for power goes up, you let the water flow back down the hill, using it to spin a turbine and generate more electricity. Pumped hydro is the biggest form of grid-scale electricity storage in the world. Unfortunately, that’s not saying much. The 10 largest facilities in the United States can store less than an hour’s worth of the country’s electricity consumption. — location: [1624]() ^ref-35918

---
At TerraPower, we’re trying to figure out how to use molten salt so that (if we’re able to build a plant) we don’t have to compete with solar- generated electricity during the day. The — location: [1642]() ^ref-46773

---
Thermal storage. The notion here is that when electricity is cheap, you use it to heat up some material. Then, when you need more electricity, you use the heat to generate power via a heat engine. This can work at 50 or 60 percent efficiency, which isn’t bad. Engineers know about many materials that can stay hot for a long time without losing much energy; the most promising approach, which some scientists and companies are working on, is to store the heat in molten salt. — location: [1637]() ^ref-58340

---
Cheap hydrogen could do that for storing electricity. The reason is that hydrogen serves as a key ingredient in fuel cell batteries. Fuel cells get their energy from a chemical reaction between two gases—usually hydrogen and oxygen—and their only by-product is water. We could use electricity from a solar or wind farm to create hydrogen, store the hydrogen as compressed gas or in another form, and then put it in a fuel cell to generate electricity on demand. In effect, we’d be using clean electricity to create a carbon-free fuel that could be stored for years and turned back into electricity at a moment’s notice. — location: [1648]() ^ref-38086

---
And we would solve the location problem I mentioned earlier; although you can’t ship sunlight in a railcar, you can turn it into fuel first and then ship it any way you — location: [1654]() ^ref-9282

---
Capturing carbon. We could keep making electricity as we do now, with natural gas and coal, but suck up the carbon dioxide before it hits the atmosphere. That’s called carbon capture and storage, and it involves installing special devices at fossil-fuel plants to absorb emissions. These “point capture” devices have existed for decades, but they’re expensive to buy and operate, they generally capture only 90 percent of the greenhouse gases involved, and power companies don’t gain anything from installing them. So — location: [1667]() ^ref-40205

---
I mentioned a related technology called direct air capture. — location: [1673]() ^ref-16637

---
DAC is a much bigger technical challenge than point capture, thanks to the low concentration of carbon dioxide in the air — location: [1678]() ^ref-63339

---
Using less — location: [1688]() ^ref-16129

---
did soften it when I realized just how much land it will take to generate lots more electricity from solar and wind — location: [1692]() ^ref-4714

---
There’s also a related approach called load shifting or demand shifting, which involves using power more consistently throughout the day — location: [1697]() ^ref-27427

---
Compared with cement and steel, plastics are the baby of the group. Although humans were using natural plastics, such as rubber — location: [1854]() ^ref-60648

---
brevity, we’ll focus on three of the most important materials: steel, concrete, and plastic — location: [1810]() ^ref-24918

---
Making 1 ton of steel produces about 1.8 tons of carbon dioxide. — location: [1831]() ^ref-20378

---
To make cement, you need calcium. To get calcium, you start with limestone—which contains calcium plus carbon and oxygen—and burn it in a furnace along with some other materials — location: [1842]() ^ref-16320

---
Make a ton of cement, and you’ll get a ton of carbon dioxide — location: [1848]() ^ref-31720

---
When we make cement or steel, we release carbon dioxide as an inevitable by-product, but when we make a plastic, around half of the carbon stays in the plastic. (The actual percentage varies quite a bit, depending on which kind of plastic you’re talking about, but around half is a reasonable approximation.) Carbon really likes bonding with the oxygen and hydrogen, and it isn’t inclined to let go. Plastics can take hundreds of years to degrade. — location: [1869]() ^ref-19838

---
But the key points remain the same: We manufacture an enormous amount of materials, resulting in copious amounts of greenhouse gases, nearly a third of the 51 billion tons per year. — location: [1881]() ^ref-37506

---
To figure the Green Premiums on materials, you need to understand where emissions come from when we make things. I think of it in three stages: We emit greenhouse gases (1) when we use fossil fuels to generate the electricity that factories need to run their operations; (2) when we use them to generate heat needed for different manufacturing processes, like melting iron ore to make steel; and (3) when we actually make these materials, like the way cement manufacturing inevitably creates carbon dioxide — location: [1886]() ^ref-16920

---
—it’s similar to a process we’ve been using for more than a century to purify aluminum—but like the other ideas for clean steel it hasn’t yet been proven to work at an industrial scale. Clean — location: [1966]() ^ref-30563

---
Clean electricity would help us solve another problem too: making plastics. If enough pieces come together, plastics could one day become a carbon sink—a way to remove carbon rather than emit it. Here’s — location: [1968]() ^ref-4295

---
buildings and roads can also be designed with the goal of limiting the use of cement and steel, and in some cases cross-laminated wood—made of layers of timber glued together into a stack—is sturdy enough to substitute for both materials — location: [1985]() ^ref-17105

---
To sum up, the path to zero emissions in manufacturing looks like this: 1. Electrify every process possible. This is going to take a lot of innovation. 2. Get that electricity from a power grid that’s been decarbonized. This also will take a lot of innovation. 3. Use carbon capture to absorb the remaining emissions. And so will this. 4. Use materials more efficiently. Same. — location: [1987]() ^ref-24982

---
Raising animals for food is a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions; it ranks as the highest contributor in the sector that experts call “agriculture, forestry, and other land use,” which in turn covers a huge range of human activity, from raising animals and growing crops to harvesting trees. This sector also involves a wide range of various greenhouse gases: With agriculture, the main culprit isn’t carbon dioxide but methane—which causes 28 times more warming per molecule than carbon dioxide over the course of a century—and nitrous oxide, which causes 265 times more warming — location: [2008]() ^ref-971

---
Around the world, there are roughly a billion cattle raised for beef and dairy. The methane they burp and fart out every year has the same warming effect as 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, accounting for about 4 percent of all global emissions. — location: [2097]() ^ref-11578

---
But there’s another cause of greenhouse gas emissions that’s common to every animal: poop. When poop decomposes, it releases a mix of powerful greenhouse gases —mostly nitrous oxide, plus some methane, sulfur, and ammonia. About half of poop-related emissions come from pig manure, and the rest from cow manure — location: [2101]() ^ref-7607

---
There are other downsides to synthetic fertilizer. To make it, we have to produce ammonia, a process that requires heat, which we get by burning natural gas, which produces greenhouse gases. Then, to move it from the facility where it’s made to the warehouse where it’s stored (like the place I visited in Tanzania) and eventually the farm where it’s used, we load it on trucks that are powered by gasoline. Finally, after the fertilizer is applied to soil, much of the nitrogen that it contains never gets absorbed by the plant. In fact, worldwide, crops take up less than half the nitrogen applied to farm fields. The rest runs off into ground or surface waters, causing pollution, or escapes into the air in the form of nitrous oxide—which, you may recall, has 265 times the global-warming potential of carbon dioxide. All told, fertilizers were responsible for roughly 1.3 billion tons of — location: [2225]() ^ref-27265

---
Microorganisms that make nitrogen expend a lot of energy in the process. So much energy, in fact, that they’ve evolved to do it only when they absolutely need to—when there’s no nitrogen in the soil around them. If they detect enough nitrogen, they stop producing it so they can use the energy for something else. So when we add synthetic fertilizer, the natural organisms in the soil sense the nitrogen and stop producing it on their own. — location: [2220]() ^ref-30868

---
We don’t have any way to capture the greenhouse gases that come from applying it. There’s no equivalent of carbon capture for nitrous oxide. That means I can’t calculate a complete Green Premium for zero-carbon fertilizer—which itself is actually useful information, because it tells us that we need significant innovation in this area. — location: [2240]() ^ref-33178

---
in effect, instead of adding nitrogen via fertilizer, you add bacteria to the soil that always produce nitrogen even when it’s already present. If these approaches work, they’ll dramatically reduce the need for fertilizer and all the emissions it’s responsible for. — location: [2256]() ^ref-44105

---
I’d broadly describe as agriculture—accounts for roughly 70 percent of emissions from farming, forestry, and other uses of land. If I had to sum up the other 30 percent in one word, it would be “deforestation. — location: [2259]() ^ref-26272

---
How much carbon dioxide can a tree absorb in its lifetime? It varies, but a good rule of thumb is 4 tons over the course of 40 years. — location: [2300]() ^ref-28119

---
Taking all these factors into account, the math suggests you’d need somewhere around 50 acres’ worth of trees, planted in tropical areas, to absorb the emissions produced by an average American in her lifetime. Multiply that by the population of the United States, and you get more than 16 billion acres, or 25 million square miles, roughly half the landmass of the world. Those trees would have to be maintained forever. And that’s just for the United States — location: [2314]() ^ref-341

---
transportation that I’ve made about electricity, manufacturing, and agriculture: We should be glad that more people and goods are moving around. — location: [2390]() ^ref-17251

---
As I mentioned, another way to get to zero is to switch to alternative liquid fuels that use carbon that was already in the atmosphere. When you burn these fuels, you’re not adding extra carbon to the air—you’re just returning the same carbon to where it was when the fuel was made — location: [2460]() ^ref-6687

---
We can also use zero-carbon electricity to combine the hydrogen in water with the carbon in carbon dioxide, resulting in hydrocarbon fuels. Because you use electricity in the process, these fuels are sometimes called electrofuels, and they have a lot of advantages. They’re drop-in fuels, and because they’re made using carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere, burning them doesn’t add to overall emissions. — location: [2497]() ^ref-23041

---
But electrofuels also have a downside: They’re very expensive. You need hydrogen to make them, and as I mentioned — location: [2502]() ^ref-51532

Unfortunately, batteries are a less practical option when it comes to long-distance buses and trucks. The bigger the vehicle you want to move, and the farther you want to drive it without recharging, the harder it’ll be to use electricity to power your engine. — location: [2514]() ^ref-4504

---
So to electrify America’s fleet of trucks, freight companies would have to shift to vehicles that carry less cargo, stop to recharge far more often, spend hours of time recharging, and somehow travel long stretches of highway where there are no recharging stations. It’s just not going to happen anytime soon — location: [2538]() ^ref-31598

---
when a jet takes off, the fuel it’s carrying accounts for 20 to 40 percent of its weight. So when I told him this startling fact—that you’d need 35 times more batteries by weight to get the same energy as jet fuel—he understood immediately. The more power you need, the heavier your plane gets. At some point, it’s so heavy that it can’t get off the ground — location: [2552]() ^ref-19392

---
the bigger the vehicle you want to move, and the farther you want to drive it without recharging, the harder it’ll be to use electricity as your power source—becomes a law. — location: [2557]() ^ref-26211

---
Finally, we need a massive effort to explore all the ways we can make advanced biofuels and cheap electrofuels. Companies and researchers are exploring several different pathways—for example, new ways to make hydrogen using electricity, or using solar power, or using microbes that naturally produce hydrogen as a by-product — location: [2649]() ^ref-32665

Heat pumps take advantage of the fact that gases and liquids change temperature as they expand and contract. — location: [2777]() ^ref-12533

An extreme example is Seattle’s Bullitt Center, which lays claim to being one of the greenest commercial buildings in the world. The Bullitt Center was designed to naturally stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer, reducing the need for heating and air-conditioning, and features other energy-saving technologies such as a superefficient elevator. At times, it can generate 60 percent more energy than it consumes, thanks to solar panels on its roof, although it’s still plugged into the city’s electric grid and draws power at night and during especially cloudy stretches. — location: [2859]() ^ref-12314

They can be designed with what developers call a supertight envelope (not much air leaking in or out), good insulation, triple-glazed windows, and efficient doors.

What does climate-proofing a city look like? For one thing, city planners need the latest data on climate risks and projections from computer models that predict the impact of climate change.

geoengineering. — location: [3184]() ^ref-17913

---
Geoengineering is a cutting-edge, “Break Glass in Case of Emergency” kind of tool. The basic idea is to make temporary changes in the earth’s oceans or atmosphere that lower the planet’s temperature. These changes wouldn’t be intended to absolve us of the responsibility to reduce emissions; they’d just buy us time to get our act together — location: [3186]() ^ref-28678

---
One involves distributing extremely fine particles—each just a few millionths of an inch in diameter —in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Scientists know that these particles would scatter sunlight and cause cooling, because they’ve watched it happen: When an especially powerful volcano erupts, it spews out a similar type of particle and measurably drives down the global temperature. Another approach to geoengineering involves brightening clouds. Because sunlight is scattered by the tops of clouds, we could scatter more — location: [3194]() ^ref-61491

---
sunlight and cool the earth by making the clouds brighter, using a salt spray that causes clouds to scatter more light. And it wouldn’t take a dramatic increase; to get the 1 percent reduction, we’d only need to brighten clouds that cover 10 percent of the earth’s area by 10 percent — location: [3200]() ^ref-22825

---
they all have three things in common. One, they’re relatively cheap compared with the scale of the problem, requiring up-front capital costs of less than $10 billion and minimal operating expenses. Two, the effect on clouds lasts for a week or so, so we could use them as long as we needed to and then stop with no long-term impacts. And three, whatever technical problems these ideas might face are nothing compared with the political hurdles they’ll definitely — location: [3203]() ^ref-14578

But geoengineering is the only known way that we could hope to lower the earth’s temperature within years or even decades without crippling the economy. There may come a day when we don’t have a choice. Best to prepare for that day now. — location: [3215]() ^ref-60638

In energy, software, and just about every other pursuit, it’s a mistake to think of innovation only in the strict, technological sense. Innovation is not just a matter of inventing a new machine or some new process; it’s also coming up with new approaches to business models, supply chains, markets, and policies that will help new inventions come to life and reach a global scale.

I’ve divided the different elements of my plan into two categories. — location: [3584]() ^ref-4501

---
One involves expanding the supply of innovations— the number of new ideas that get tested—and the other involves accelerating the demand for innovations. The two work hand in hand, in a push-and-pull fashion. Without demand for innovation, inventors and policy makers won’t have any incentive to push out new ideas; without a steady supply of innovations, buyers won’t have the green products the world needs to get to zero. — location: [3585]() ^ref-62739
