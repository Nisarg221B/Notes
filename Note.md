"Please reach out to Grace; you will work in her team" was the best Teams message I have received to date. I feel lucky and grateful to have worked under you, akka, learning like Eklavya by seeing you work; you've been both a mentor and a great friend to me. 
I will miss you around here‚Äîour lunches, coffee breaks, working on projects, huddles, especially you sitting in front of me! And yes, "KP is not on the desk." I know you will thrive wherever you go, so just keep believing in yourself like you always do. You know you rock! ü§ò
