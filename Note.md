"Please reach out to Grace, you will work in her team" was the best teams message I have got till date, I feel lucky and sincerely grateful to have worked under you akka, I have always been aklavya learning by observing you work across the table. You have been an inspiration and a true mentor to me. Will miss you around here, our bunk to lunches and work on projects, in huddle, especially in front of me! and yes "kp is not on the desk". I know you will thrive wherever you go, so just keep believing in yourself like you always do. You know you rock !.
