Machine Learning Vs Artificial Intelligence : 

AI refers to broad capabilities of machines to perform activities with human like intelligence. 

ML is a type of AI which allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without explicitly programmed to do so.

- In <b>supervised learning</b>, every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values. 
- In unsupervised learning , there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.

In both supervised and unsupervised learning model inspect data to discover patterns, then human use the patterns learned by the model to gain new insights or make prediction.

- InÂ **reinforcement learning**, the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward on the way to reaching a specific goal.

In a way Machine learning automate some of this statistical reasoning and pattern matching which programmer would do traditionally.

machine learning involve three primary components:

-   A machine learning model
	A block of code used to solve different problems

-   A model training algorithm
	An iterative process
	     - computes models results on data
	     - makes small changes to the model to make these results better
-   A model inference algorithm
	using a trained model to generate predictions
