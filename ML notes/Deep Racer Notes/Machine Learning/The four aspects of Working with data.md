## Building a dataset 

Machine Learning practitioners spend nearly 80% of their time working on preparing data.

- **Data Collection**  - Find and collect data related to the problem you defined

- **Data Inspection** - inspect the integrity or quality of data 
				- Outliers
				- Missing or incomplete data
				- Transforming the data ( converting categorical to numeric) based on the requirement of the model to be used.
- **Summary Statistics** ( mean, standard deviation , IQR(inner quartile range))
				- Summary Statistics can identify 
						- trends in the data
						- shape of the data
						- scale of the data
- **Data Visualization** to communicate findings to project stakeholders.
