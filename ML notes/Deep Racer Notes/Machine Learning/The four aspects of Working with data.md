## Building a dataset 

Machine Learning practitioners spend nearly 80% of their time working on preparing data.

- **Data Collection**  - Find and collect data related to the problem you defined

Data collection can be as straightforward as running the appropriate SQL queries or as complicated as building custom web scraper applications to collect data for your project. You might even have to run a model over your data to generate needed labels. Here is the fundamental question:  
  
Does the data you've collected match the machine learning task and problem you have defined?

- **Data Inspection** - inspect the integrity or quality of data 
				- Outliers
				- Missing or incomplete data
				- Transforming the data ( converting categorical to numeric) based on the requirement of the model to be used. Data that needs to be transformed or preprocessed so it's in the correct format to be used by your model
- **Summary Statistics** ( mean, standard deviation , IQR(inner quartile range))
				- Summary Statistics can identify 
						- trends in the data
						- shape of the data
						- scale of the data
- **Data Visualization** to communicate findings to project stakeholders.
