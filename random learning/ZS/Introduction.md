I am Nisarg Patel and I am computer science and engineering graduate, I have done my B-Tech from Nirma University , I have passion for everything related to data . Analyzing the data and understanding its story is what I like.

To talk about my experience i was posted as machine learning intern at a service based company called Feynn labs Services , my job was to analyse and segment the markets to better understand the customer base.

Other than this , in my spare time I like to read books and play basketball if the weather allows me to.
