**Data analyst swara**

 - There was a issue where the agencys customer base was decreasing and a solid reason was not to be found because of lack of structure on how the company was addressing this issue. When I was hired as a data analyst I tried to get to the root cause of the problem.
 - Was it because of agencys after sales service or was it because of some external factor or the inefficiency of the sales dept or people preferred different product.
 - I started by analysing the peoples choice and found out that the oil which the agency was selling was still in hot demand but due to its heavy pricing and low margin the petrol pumps and showrooms where not marketing it the way they should. + they were buying the same oil illegally to avoid taxes which is a major loss for us.
 - So I suggested the agency three options one was to market their oil on the petrol pumps itself as they cannot refuse it as its govts own oil. and second to talk over with the petrol pumps and garages of repercussions if they still continue the same behaviour.
 - and third was to also sell and market the product to local garages.
