1. **Introduction** 

I am Nisarg Patel and I am computer science and engineering graduate, I have done my B-Tech from Nirma University , I have passion for everything related to data . analyzing the data and understanding its story is what drove me to apply to this position.

To talk about my experience i was posted as machine learning intern at a service based company called Feynn labs Services , my job was to analyse and segment the markets to better understand the customer base.

Other than this , in my spare time I like to read books and play basketball if the weather allows me to.

Thank you , for Listening so patiently.

2. **Why do you want to work with us ?** 

First of all I love to work with data and getting the gist of the story the data is trying telling and its implication is my passion plus  I believe I possess the necessary skills to be an asset to the organization and of course there's no stop to learning and for which I know that there's nothing better than being a part of Ionâ€™s expert team to understand the data and its implications at its core and the business around it.

Secondly I am very interested in the future of finance and banking sector with the outbreaks of advance technologies at hand , here I think ION will be a perfect place as majority of the innovations around tech in finance involves ION ( whether it is forex or platforms for trading in equity market or market or data analyses or treasury management). ( like fidessa , wall street system , dash etc)

3. **Which location do you prefer and why**

I would prefer pune first as its very near to my home state + its very convenient for me to visit my parents if need be. second is delhi, gurugram as it has really powerful vibes and I strive in it.

4. **Why do you want to apply to a non-tech role** 

I was appointed as a team lead in my current internship ....
