- Thinking about the overall idea of the story is important, once the idea is formed  we can start with screen story structure. once you have the idea for characters and conflicts were do you want to end ... 

- Starting with coming up with a ending (you are not tied to it ) get the basics lined up so that you are going somewhere. 

- Plan surprises(key moments, at the end of act 1 and at the end of act 2) for the audience and the hero. this surprises has to be very impactful on the hero. 

- Writing a beginning is important in a sense to give the audience a moment to connect emotionally with your hero specifically and defining a plot. 

### Deciding on Your Hero's Three world

- ACT THREE  ( Act 3 has to very short )
	- _New World_ Improvise 
		- (Here is mature now , they have overcome some of the emotional reticence within and they are ready to fact the adversary for all the marbles)

	-- Denouement 
	-- Obligatory Scene
	-- Stunning Surprise 2 ^ ( raise a bar )

- ACT TWO -- Midpoint (series of short things in several key thing which advance the story happens)
	- *Special World* Specific Goal 
		- (here the hero realises that they darn well better grow up emotionally or they're never going to be able to do what they need to do to their goal and then act three is their maturity now)
		Here the hero has highly specific goal to pursue , life -death situation or similarly incredibly difficult and different situation, than hero forms a plan and purse the plan throughout the act two cobbling it together as it  keeps getting torn apart and at the climax of act tow the plan gets totally blown out of the water and destroyed and all of sudden there is no plan, and than that throws the hero in to act 3 where they must improvise.
	
	-- Stunning Surprise 1 ^ ( raise a bar ) ( it has to change everything , it has to change the heros life forever)
	
	-- Inciting Incident  ( which beings this story and no other, which also binds the hero to the main story  and lead the story to stunning surprise one )

		 hero pursuing a general goal and something happens at the end of act 1 to drop the curtain for act 2)
