### SQL

- Finding second highest salary in a department
- perform A-B without using the minus operation
- SQL queries based on Joins, Correlated queries, and Subqueries

### Core questions

- Check if a number is Palindrome or Not with both the Iterative and Recursive approaches.
- He assigned me a coding question based on a puzzle, so I had to solve that puzzle and find a pattern in it, followed by coding the same using pen and paper.

- Normalization, 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF.
- JOINS - DBMS - questions like self-join
- ACID Properties
- OOP - polymorphism, runtime-polymorphism, code for function overloading and function overriding
-  ACID Properties.
- Delete, Drop and Truncate
- Why Normalization and de-normalization?
- Difference between Primary key and foreign key
- 3NF and how it is better than 2NF.
- ML Concepts as I mentioned in my resume. 
- Questions are like Supervised and unsupervised learning, Classification and regression, Activation Functions, Loss Functions, etc., All the questions are based on my project.
- Thrashing 
- OOPS four pillars
- Difference between Multiprogramming and Multithreading
- Why Java is not 100% OOPS.
- Why Virtual Memory
- The life cycle of a process.
Q5-What is indexing and hashing in DBMS.  
Q6-Interface in Java.  
Q7-Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation.  
Q8-Multithreading in Java.
4. What is [indexing in DBMS?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/indexing-in-databases-set-1/) Types of indexing? How you can implement indexing using B-tree and B+ tree? Lot of discussion on [B-tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/b-tree-set-1-introduction-2/) and B+ tree-insertion and deletion.  
5. What is [BST](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/binary-search-tree/)? Give a real-life example.  
6. What are the types of link list? How to detect and remove a loop in link list?  
7. Lot of questions was asked based on my projects( Machine Learning and neural network).  

### Puzzles 

- [How Many Squares On A Chessboard?](https://www.teachingideas.co.uk/maths/how-many-squares-on-a-chessboard/)
- make 120 with any number of 0s using any arithmetic operators
- 
### HR Questions

- He asked me about my projects and what technologies I used in them.
- Where do you live?
- How many family members are there in your family and what do they do?
- Why is there decrement in marks in graduation compared to 12th?
- Why are you interested in joining us?
