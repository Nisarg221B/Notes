### SQL

- Finding second highest salary in a department
- perform A-B without using the minus operation

- Given 2 tables of employee containing employee_id,employee_name and department containing employee_id(foreign key), dept_id find the name of the employee who worked in maximum no. of departments.

- you have given a employee table in which you have their salary and employee name.  
     Write a query to find the nth highest salary and the employee name.
