Be silent + thank you so much I really appreciate the offer and for showing your trust in me I have couple of questions that i had like to talk to you about if thats okay , hm I see here that the annual salary is .... based on my research on the market and past exrience when MAQ visited my campus I was expecting a salary of around 11.


do you have a practice of sign on bonus because that could help bridge the gap i have in mind.


accepting offer - 10 lpa and 10% - 11


salary + individual components  +  transportation allowance / Relocation allowance  + Holidays + bonus

be silent + polite 

take time - ask for thinking time - do not accept or reject any offer
