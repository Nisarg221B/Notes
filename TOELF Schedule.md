10 DBT: Shortlisted around 6 score recipients. Later, narrowed down to 4. 

7 DBT: Read Magoosh's Guide to TOEFL thoroughly. I took one entire Sunday off from lab and went through Magoosh's Guide for TOEFL iBT in its entirety (around 160 pages). Do make sure you read actively. A lot of advice may sound repetitive, but trust me, it is crucial to get that drilled into your head. Read up on all the sections, not just the ones at which you feel you are weak.

6 DBT: Searched for practice questions, found the TOEFL archive linked above.

5 DBT: Solved Reading and Listening sections from Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 of the archive (no audio files available, so only read and solved MCQs for listening section as well).

3 DBT: Finalized four score recipients, entered and submitted details.

2 DBT: Solved vol. 3 and 4 of the archive above. Played all the listening section tracks, took proper notes following the Magoosh-suggested strategy and answered questions in a timed manner.

1 DBT: Took the entire day off from lab. Focused fully on the speaking section.



READING SECTION:

First, just scroll to the questions directly and answer the word-meaning ones. For these, you obviously don't really need to read the passage, just the sentence containing the word will do. 

This will also give you confidence since you'll be done with 2-4 questions within a couple of minutes. Then proceed to read the passage and answer the rest.

LISTENING SECTION:

For the listening section, you need to really practice taking quick, effective notes. 

WRITING SECTION:

However, I'd definitely say that it's important to understand the expected format and keep a couple of templates in mind, given the specific nature of the TOEFL scoring rubrics, and the highly constrained time. For this, watch the Magoosh Writing Practice video featuring Lucas Fink (link below).

SPEAKING SECTION:

Speaking, as I've already mentioned, was the one section where I was heavily benefitted by practice and the videos/material. 

You may be a good speaker, but the TOEFL speaking isn't anything like the stage. I can testify to this - normally, I absolutely love going up on stage, often with zero prep. But the TOEFL speaking sections, with their regimented format and weird time limits, completely threw me off balance.
