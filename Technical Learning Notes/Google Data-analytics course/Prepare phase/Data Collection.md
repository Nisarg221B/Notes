## Transforming data

**Long data** is data where **each row contains a single data point** for a particular item. In the long data example below, individual stock prices (data points) have been collected for Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOGL) (particular items) on the given dates.

**Wide data** is data where **each row contains multiple data points** for the particular items identified in the columns.Â

With data transformed to wide data, you can create a chart comparing how each company's stock changed over the same period of time.

You might notice that all the data included in the long format is also in the wide format. But wide data is easier to read and understand. That is why data analysts typically transform long data to wide data more often than they transform wide data to long data.


## Data biases

- Sampling bias - is when a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole
- Observer bias - it's the tendency for different people to observe things differently
- Interpretation bias -  The tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive, or negative way. Interpretation bias, can lead to two people seeing or hearing the exact same thing, and interpreting it in a variety of different ways  because they have different backgrounds, and experiences.
- Confirmation bias - Confirmation bias, is the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs.
