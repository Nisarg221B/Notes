Sometimes the data to support a business objective isn’t readily available. This is when proxy data is useful. Take a look at the following scenarios and where proxy data comes in for each example:

### **Business scenario** & the proxy data analyst might use

1. A new car model was just launched a few days ago and the auto dealership can’t wait until the end of the month for sales data to come in. They want sales projections now.

- The analyst proxies the number of clicks to the car specifications on the dealership’s website as an estimate of potential sales at the dealership.

2. A brand new plant-based meat product was only recently stocked in grocery stores and the supplier needs to estimate the demand over the next four years. 

- The analyst proxies the sales data for a turkey substitute made out of tofu that has been on the market for several years.

3. The Chamber of Commerce wants to know how a tourism campaign is going to impact travel to their city, but the results from the campaign aren’t publicly available yet.

- The analyst proxies the historical data for airline bookings to the city one to three months after a similar campaign was run six months earlier.
