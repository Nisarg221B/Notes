1.  **Information**: the data you are working with
2.  **Story**: a clear and compelling narrative or concept
3.  **Goal**: a specific objective or function for the visual
4.  **Visual form**: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

Note: One useful way of approaching this framework is to notice the parts of the graphic where there is incomplete overlap between all four elements. For example, visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art. Data plus visual form without a goal or function is eye candy. Data with a goal but no story or visual form is boring. All four elements need to be at work to create an effective visual.


### Pre-attentive attributes: marks and channels

#### Marks
**Marks** are basic visual objects. Every mark can be broken down into four qualities:
1. size - How big, small, long, or tall a mark is

3. shape - Whether a specific object is given a shape that communicates something about it

4. position -  Where a specific mark is in space in relation to a scale or to other marks

5. color

### Channels 
**Channels** are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data.

1. **Accuracy** - Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented?
2. **Popout** - How easy is it to distinguish certain values from others?
3. **Grouping** - How good is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data?
