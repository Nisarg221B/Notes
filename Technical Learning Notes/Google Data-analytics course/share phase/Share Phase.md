1.  **Information**: the data you are working with
2.  **Story**: a clear and compelling narrative or concept
3.  **Goal**: a specific objective or function for the visual
4.  **Visual form**: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

Note: One useful way of approaching this framework is to notice the parts of the graphic where there is incomplete overlap between all four elements. For example, visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art. Data plus visual form without a goal or function is eye candy. Data with a goal but no story or visual form is boring. All four elements need to be at work to create an effective visual.
