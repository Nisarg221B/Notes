#### David McCandless method

1.  **Information**: the data you are working with
2.  **Story**: a clear and compelling narrative or concept
3.  **Goal**: a specific objective or function for the visual
4.  **Visual form**: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

Note: One useful way of approaching this framework is to notice the parts of the graphic where there is incomplete overlap between all four elements. For example, visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art. Data plus visual form without a goal or function is eye candy. Data with a goal but no story or visual form is boring. All four elements need to be at work to create an effective visual.


### Pre-attentive attributes: marks and channels

#### Marks
**Marks** are basic visual objects. Every mark can be broken down into four qualities:
1. size - How big, small, long, or tall a mark is

3. shape - Whether a specific object is given a shape that communicates something about it

4. position -  Where a specific mark is in space in relation to a scale or to other marks

5. color

### Channels 
**Channels** are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data.

1. **Accuracy** - Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented?
2. **Popout** - How easy is it to distinguish certain values from others?
3. **Grouping** - How good is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data?

### Correlation vs Causation 

When you make conclusions from data analysis, you need to make sure that you don’t assume a causal relationship between elements of your data when there is only a correlation. When your data shows that outdoor temperature and ice cream consumption both go up at the same time, it might be tempting to conclude that hot weather **causes** people to eat ice cream. But, a closer examination of the data would reveal that every change in temperature doesn’t lead to a change in ice cream purchases. In addition, there might have been a sale on ice cream at the same time that the data was collected, which might not have been considered in your analysis. 

Knowing the difference between correlation and causation is important when you make conclusions from your data since the stakes could be high.

##### **Cause of disease**

For example, pellagra is a disease with symptoms of dizziness, sores, vomiting, and diarrhea. In the early 1900s, people thought that the disease was caused by unsanitary living conditions. Most people who got pellagra also lived in unsanitary environments. But, a closer examination of the data showed that pellagra was the result of a lack of niacin (Vitamin B3). Unsanitary conditions were related to pellagra because most people who couldn’t afford to purchase niacin-rich foods also couldn’t afford to live in more sanitary conditions. But, dirty living conditions turned out to be a correlation only.
