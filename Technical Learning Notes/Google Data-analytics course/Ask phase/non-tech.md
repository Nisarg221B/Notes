2. What they already know
3. What they need to know

## Crafting a compelling agenda for a meeting

A solid meeting agenda sets your meeting up for success. Here are the basic parts your agenda should include: 

-   Meeting start and end time
-   Meeting location (including information to participate remotely, if that option is available)
-   Objectives 
-   Background material or data the participants should review beforehand
