few ineffective ways to ask (ineffective questions):
- Leading Questions 
	 - questions which lead you to answer in certain way
	 - eg : these are the best sandwiches ever , aren't they ? 
- Vague and Lacks context 
	- you prefer chocolate or vanilla ?
	 Well, what are they specifically talking about? Ice cream, pudding, coffee flavouring or something else? What if you like chocolate ice cream but vanilla in your coffee? What if you don't like either flavour? That's the problem with this question
- Close ended questions
- Assumptious questions
	- what do you love most about our exhibits ? 
	assumes the customers loved the exhibition.

Effective questions follows SMART methodology

**S**pecific 
**M**easurable
**A**ction Oriented
**R**elevant
**T**ime bounded

### Specific 
specific questions are simple, significant and focused on a single topic or closely related ideas.

are kids getting enough physical activities these days? Ask what percentage of kids achieve the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity at least five days a week? 

### Measurable  
Measurable questions can be quantified and accessed.

why did a recent video go viral? Instead, you could ask how many times was our video shared on social channels the first week it was posted?

This question is measurable as it lets us count the shares and arrive at a concrete number.

### Action Oriented
Action-Oriented questions encourage change.

So rather than asking, how can we get customers to recycle our product packaging? You could ask, what design features will make our packaging easier to recycle? This brings you answers you can act on. 

### Relevant & Time bounded
Relevant questions matter, are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve. 

Let's say you're working on a problem related to a threatened species of frog. And you asked, why does it matter that Pine Barrens tree frogs started disappearing? This is an irrelevant question because the answer won't help us find a way to prevent these frogs from going extinct.

A more relevant question would be, what environmental factors changed in Durham, North Carolina between **1983 and 2004** that could cause Pine Barrens tree frogs to disappear from the Sandhills Regions?

Time bound questions specify the time to be studied.
