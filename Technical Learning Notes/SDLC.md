-   It explains why project planning, scheduling, and budgeting are necessary.


1. **Planning** ( what do clients want )
2. **Gathering Requirements** ( what the application is supposed to perform and what it needs )
3. **Design** (distilling all of the software project's requirements, analysis, and design information , t is a simulation of how a software application will work.)
4. **Development**
5. **Testing**
6. **Deployment**
7. **Maintenance** - ( Users find flaws that were not discovered during testing. These issues must be addressed, which may result in new development cycles.)

**Agile Methodology**  - This mechanism divides the product into small builds and these small builds are developed with proper designing, coding, and testing with meetings until one build is completed. After this build, the other requirements are analyzed and the previous process is repeated until the final product is developed. The time for each build is called Sprints.

**Iterative Model** :- Â It primarily focuses on preliminary growth and design, then gradually develops momentum as more complex and needs are met until the final software is completely constructed
