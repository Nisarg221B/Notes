-   It explains why project planning, scheduling, and budgeting are necessary.


1. **Planning** ( what do clients want )
2. **Gathering Requirements** ( what the application is supposed to perform and what it needs )
3. **Design** (distilling all of the software project's requirements, analysis, and design information , t is a simulation of how a software application will work.)
4. **Development**
5. **Testing**
6. **Deployment**
7. **Maintenance** - ( Users find flaws that were not discovered during testing. These issues must be addressed, which may result in new development cycles.)

**Agile Methodology**  - divide jobs into smaller iterations or sections and avoid long-term planning entirely. The number of iterations, duration, and scope of each iteration are all clearly determined ahead of time. In the Agile process model, each iteration is a small-time "frame" that lasts anywhere from one to four weeks.

**Iterative Model** :- Â It primarily focuses on preliminary growth and design, then gradually develops momentum as more complex and needs are met until the final software is completely constructed
