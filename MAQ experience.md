Dear BCG Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in the machine learning engineer position at BCG.

With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering and professional experience at MAQ Software, I have acquired skills in Microsoft Azure, Azure Data Bricks, Data Pipelines, Python, and SQL.

During my time at MAQ Software, I developed a power app for Microsoft Partners to create Campaign URLs, created a Power BI dashboard linking on-premise and cloud databases, and managed Azure data pipelines. Additionally, I implemented data validation processes and automated data refresh. Through dataset analysis and cleansing, I successfully recovered 25% of campaign traffic data, significantly enhancing tracking accuracy.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to BCG's innovative projects and believe that my skills align well with the requirements of the role.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team.

Warm regards,

Nisarg Patel
