#### What exactly are streams ?

Streams are collections of data — just like arrays or strings. The difference is that streams might not be available all at once, and they don’t have to fit in memory. This makes streams really powerful when working with large amounts of data, or data that’s coming from an external source one _chunk_ at a time.

In Node, there are four different types of streams:

- Readable streams → To create a stream of data for reading (say, reading a large file in chunks).
- Writable streams → To create a stream of data for writing (say, writing a large amount of data to a file).
- Duplex streams → To create a stream that is both readable and writable at the same time. We can read and write to a duplex stream (say, a socket connection between a client and a server).
- Transform streams → To create a stream that is readable and writable, but the data can be modified while reading and writing to the stream (say, compressing data by the client and server before while requesting).
