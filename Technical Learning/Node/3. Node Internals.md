### How does node allow us to run code asynchronously 

Node executes javaScript code, so it has to follow how the language works in begin single threaded , in Node we have one main thread which runs the V8 engine, our javaScript code including the node APIs as well as a super important part of Libuv ,which is event loop.

libuv is written in c which is multithreaded and thus it offers a thread pool which is a collection of threads ( by default 4 threads) which handles asynchronous I/O delegated by node to libuv which is then put on one of the four thread by the event loop.

The main thread executes the javascript code, when the delegated I/O task is finished on one of the thread in the thread pool , the event loop is notified of the results which then put the to be execute function (call back function )  in the queue. 

In libuv not all asynchronous I/O are executed in thread pool , most network related  async I/O are delegated to the kernel or system which has its own capabilities and threads which when the request is completed notifies the event loop. this leaves the thread pool out of the pictures thus not overflowing the thread pools.

- this means as a node developer we don't have to worry about multithreading which simplifies how we write code. node already knows who should do the work to get the job done. its only the code behind node or code behind the OS which has multiple threads and uses those threads to perform input and output tasks. its this internals which allows node to do its non-blocking I/O.


## Phases of Event loop

#### Callback Queues

there are four callback queues for each type of function the event loop needs to execute , in the single run the event loop first checks for timers than I/O callback and so on and so forth and then repeat.

## What is node best at ?

so basically node runtime works asynchronously by delegating the tasks to different devices like network adapter or hard disk for read write , so node will not work particularly good where the CPU itself has to work like video processing or machine learning this are blocking processor heavy computation they block our CPU or GPU. 

What node is really good at is servers and the various things that servers do , like taking to databases and coordinating with many other servers and services on the web for things like emails and authentication. therefore node works really well when your main performance problem is input and output (network or fs) rather than heavy calculation. it works best when we can delegate these tasks to our operating system and the devices on our computer. 

for ex; video streaming like Netflix which is mainly input and output, sending video files from a database of videos through a server like node and into a user's web browser or a Netflix application.
