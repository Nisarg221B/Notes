```json
"devDependencies": {
"nodemon": "^3.0.1"
},
"dependencies": {
"body-parser": "^1.20.2",
"ejs": "^3.1.9",
"express": "^4.18.2",
"pug": "^3.0.2"
}
```

body-parser : ^1.20.2       =>   1.20.2 <= x < 2.0.0

^ implies that package.json is allowed to install any version of this package as long as its not a major version update. it can install x in the range above. 

thus its a good idea to share package-lock.json which stores the exact version of the third party module used.

in case the major version is 0 => 0.8.1 , the minor version 8 is considered to the major version and all other rules remains the same.

#### Vulnerability issues

- we can use "npm audit" to see if any severe vulnerability

- npm audit fix - updates the package in question if the update is available , in case if its not its a good choice to use alternate library.

npm commands

npm install -g  nodemon                            ( installing globally )
npm install --save-dev nodemon             ( just a development dependency )
npm install --save nodemon                     ( production dependency )

npm audit               ( looks for vulnerability issues in the installed packages )
npm audit fix 

npm uninstall nodemon              ( uninstall a package from the project )
npm uninstall -g nodemon         ( uninstall a package globally )
