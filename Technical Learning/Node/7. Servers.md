### 1. HTTP request  

With HTTP our API is made up of operations using these methods like get and post, which we saw that are used on different collections of data. 

Every http request is made up of four components

1. METHOD     -  POST
2. PATH            - /messages ( endpoints  )
3. BODY           
					- generally json   { text:"hello" , photo: "smile.jpg"}  
					- (optional, not every has to have it )
4. HEADERS    
					- metadata (data about the data we are sending , data about the request)
					- ex: size of the data we are sending , authentication information so that the server knows you are allowed to perform that operation with your user. ( this are optional depending upon your use case)
					- Host:facebook.com (this is compulsory header - host) , it specifies which server your request is being sent to , including sometimes the port number for that site. 

##### HTTP Methods
<i> http verbs </i>

1. **Get** 
The `GET` method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using `GET` should only retrieve data.
2. **POST**
The `POST` method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
3. **PUT**
The `PUT` method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
4. **DELETE** 
The `DELETE` method deletes the specified resource.

**Examples** 

- GET /friends       - general collection 
- GET /friends/5    - specific 

- POST /messages      
- <s>POST /messages/15</s>  - we generally only add to a collections and not to individual items
- PUT /messages/15    - but we can update a item in a collection using PUT

- DELETE /messages/15
- DELETE /friends/5




### 2. HTTP Responses 

Every http response is made up of three components

1. HEADERS    
					- (optional list of headers ) 
					- Content-Type: application/json
					- above header implies the body contains json
2. BODY           
					- { text:"hello" , photo: "smile.jpg"}  
3. STATUS CODE 
					- 200 ( if the response is successful one)

##### HTTP response status codes

Generally the X00 response codes are more generic and the others in line more specific

- Informational responses ( 100-199 )
- Successful responses ( 200-209 )
	- `200 ok` , The request succeeded. ( for all the methods )
	- `201 created` , The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. This is typically the response sent after `POST` requests, or some `PUT` requests.

- Redirects ( 300-399 )
	- `301 Moved Permanently` , The URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently. The new URL is given in the response.

- Client errors ( 400-499 ) ( something is wrong about the request )
	- `400 Bad Request` , The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error. ( more generic error)
	- `401 Unauthorised` , Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorised", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.
	- `403 Forbidden` , The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorised, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorised, the client's identity is known to the server.
	- `404 Not Found` , The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist.
	- `405 Method Not Allowed` , The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource. 
	- `408 Request Timeout`, This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client. It means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection.

- Server errors ( 500-599 ) ( while the request is ok , the server is at fault )
	- `500 Internal Server error ` , The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.
	- `501 Not Implemented` ,  when something is under development
	- `503 Service Unavailable`, Used when theres some temporary issue with the server side which is cause the service to be unavailable. 
	- `504 Gateway Timeout`, This error response is given when the server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time.

### 3. Origin Policy 

- What is an origin ? 

origin is the combination of this three things 
![[Screenshot 2023-09-18 at 10.22.20 PM.png|500]]
you can change the above three and the origin still won't change.


- Same origin policy is a security feature by your browser that restricts what your browser is allowed to load when you're browsing pages on the internet. it is a rule that is enforced by browsers to control access to data between web applications.
	- This policy does not prevent writing between web applications it prevents reading between web applications.
	- Access is based on Origin
