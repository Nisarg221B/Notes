### V8 engine 

(written in c++)

- JST ( just in time compiler) in V8

- using just the complier will be slow the first time it has to compile the whole code and get the machine code out of it. which is not ideal in cases like browser where we just want the javascript code to run directly
- thus javascript has to be ideally interpreted language.
- though interpreted languages has a problem that they get slow in the long run due to lack of optimisations like running the same whole code again and again instead of just passing the optimised version. 
- thus the Just in time complier or JST was introduced in 2000s which takes the best of the both world.

JST in V8 engine
- here the code is passed till the interpreter and then converted to bytecode (not as low level as machine code) which can be directly interpreted by the javascript engine.
- And then theres something called profiler or monitor which keeps tab on how the things are called in the code at the interpreter and takes the some code out of it for optimisation and pass on to the complier and then add the optimised code back to the byte code.
- this way as our program keeps on running it gets better and better due to optimisation  at run time by profiler.

Thing about bytecode is that it is not understood by all machines directly like a machine code. thus with bytecode, you need software such as the virtual machine or a javascript engine so it can execute it. (just like a java virtual machine in case of java).

so Is javascript an interpreted language? - Not technically, 
in the initial years yes, but the things have evolved now and it depends on the javascript engine thus depends on the implementation . 

##### Optimising the code for JST

this are the things you need to take care of , they might confuse the compiler because of which compiler won't optimize them.

```javascript
// inline caching
function findUser(user){
	return `found ${user.fistName} ${user.lastName}`
}
const userData{
	firstName: 'Johnson',
	lastName : 'Junior'
}

findUser(userData);
findUser(userData);
// if we call findUser over and over findUser(userData) becomes 
// 'found Johnson Junior'
```

```javascript
// Hidden classes 
function Animal(x,y){
	this.x = x;
	this.y = y;
}

const obj1 = new Animal(1,2);
const obj2 = new Animal(3,4);

obj1.a = 30;
obj1.b = 100;

/** the below code will make the compiler run slow 

You wan to try and instantiate your object properties in the same order so that hidden classes, which is what the compiler uses underneath the hood.( to see if the objects have same hidden class or properties so that it can optimize it).

but as soon as you start and create the properties in different order the compliers going to get confused and say they don't have a shared hidden class , there are two seperate things, and internally thats going to slow things down. 
*/
obj2.b = 40;
obj2.a = 50;

/*
thats why theres an issue with delete keywork also
if i do this 
*/
delete obj1.x;
// I change the hidden class for obj1 
```


### why not just use machine code from the beginning ? 

- if we have to do all this interpretation and compiling of the language, why not just use the machine code from the beginning , why don't all programs just use machine code ahead of time, we compile our code lets say javascript and the we give our websites our machine code so they don't even have to worry about all this complier interpretation and JIT compiler. 

- You see , if javascript were compiled , then either compilation would have to be super fast because remember our javascript files get sent from the server to the browser, so the compiling has to happen on the browser or the competing browser this is Firefox , Microsoft Edge, Chrome browsers , safari would have to agree on some binary executable format or standard that can understand this machine code because at the end of the day, these browsers are the ones that are executing the code. 
- We now have something called WebAssembly and something that you should keep an eye on because. we have the standard binary executable format called **web assembly.** we might not need to do this compilation , interpretation on the browsers in future. 

## Stack and heap

### Stack
- be careful about stack overflow , thus using deeply nested function are not a good idea (callback hell);
- Javascript is single threaded thus only one stack is available

### Heap
### Garbage collection in javascript
- javascript is a garbage collected language , that means that javascript allocated memory when its not in use or required javascript cleans it up for us. 
- so javascript automatically frees  ups this memory that we no longer use and well collect our garbage

![[Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 3.24.27 PM.png|400]]

The garbage collector freeze memory on the heap and prevents what we call memory leaks that is , when the memory gets too big, too big until we reach our maximum size. 
this gives us false security that there are no memory leaks. 

- Javascript uses Mark and sweep algorithm for garbage collection 

imagine on left here we have variables which points to various objects  and perhaps that object points another object and so on and so forth in our program.

- We mark all the linked objects
![[Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 3.28.06 PM.png|400]]
- and sweep the unlink ones

#### lets see how memory leeks still happens 

```javascript 

// Memory leaks 

// silly example - simply by silly mistake 
let array = [];
for(let i = 5 ; i > 1 ;i++){// infinite loop
	array.push(i-1);
}

// 1. global variables
var a = 1; // if this were nested objects they won't get free ever as they are in global scope.
var b = 2;


// 2. event listners - when we keep on adding this event listners over and over and we don't remove them when we don't need them. because they are just there in the background we forget about them and that creates memory leak
var element = document.getElementById('button');
element.addEventListner('click',onClick);

// 3. another one is like simply using setInterval

setInterval(()={
	// referencing objects...
	// this objects are never going to be collected by garbage collector because this set interval, unless we clear it and stop it, is going to keep running and running.  
})
```
