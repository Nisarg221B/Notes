#### What is node ?

- Node is a javascript runtime
- What is a runtime
	- it a javascript environment which allows us to run javascript as well as do some extra stuff.

- NodeJS also implements a Javascript runtime using Chrome's v8 engine as well as the Libuv library (event loop and worker threads).

Now done has V8 Engine which helps it to run javascript very efficiently  , but in order for it to do a lot more than just read javascript for example may be real files, maybe access database , maybe just run somethings that aren't part of the V8 engine aren't part of javascript. thats where the libuv comes in. everytime node sees something which is not part of javascript it passes on to the libuv.

- libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides support for asynchronous I/O based on event loops.
 

- Is web browser a javascript runtime ? - Yes, A browser contains a Javascript engine (for example Chrome v8). The engine implements a Javascript runtime, which includes the call stack, heap and event loop. The browser also usually includes a set of APIs that augment the Javascript runtime and make asynchronous code execution possible.
