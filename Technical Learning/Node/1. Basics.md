#### What is node ?

- Node is a javascript runtime
- What is a runtime
	- it a javascript environment which allows us to run javascript as well as do some extra stuff.

- NodeJS also implements a Javascript runtime using Chrome's v8 engine as well as the Libuv library (event loop and worker threads).

Now done has V8 Engine which helps it to run javascript very efficiently  , but in order for it to do a lot more than just read javascript for example may be real files, maybe access database , maybe just run somethings that aren't part of the V8 engine aren't part of javascript. thats where the libuv comes in. everytime node sees something which is not part of javascript it passes on to the libuv.

- libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides support for asynchronous I/O based on event loops.
 

- Is web browser a javascript runtime ? - Yes, A browser contains a Javascript engine (for example Chrome v8). The engine implements a Javascript runtime, which includes the call stack, heap and event loop. The browser also usually includes a set of APIs that augment the Javascript runtime and make asynchronous code execution possible.

The event loop and callback queue are the pieces of the same puzzle. They are not part of the Javascript engine, rather they sit outside JavaScript engine and normally provided by the runtime such as a web browser or Node.js. The event loop uses JavaScript engine’s APIs to communicate with it and provide callback functions to execute.
### Even loop inside Node.js

- NodeJS also implements a Javascript runtime using Chrome's v8 engine as well as the Libuv library (event loop and worker threads).

- Node.js uses **Google’s V8 engine** to provide JavaScript runtime and employes its own event loop using the [**libuv**](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) library (_written in c_). Node follows the same callback approach like Web APIs and works in a similar fashion as the browser.

- V8, event queue, and event loop runs on the single thread while worker threads are responsible to provide asynchronous I/O operation. That’s why Node.js is said to have as **non-blocking event-driven asynchronous I/O architecture**.
