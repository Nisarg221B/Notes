In observer design patter, theres a subject and observers who subscribes to it. any event which happens to the subject is notified to the observers as long as they are subscribed to that subject and they all can react to it independently. 

**Observer** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.
