*What aspects of project management will differ for a media/publishing client compared to an e-commerce client?*

while the core aspects of project management such as planning, designing development and testing remains similar for both the clients certain components needs to be done differently which would reflect the distinct priorities and requirements for the respective client. 

- e-commerce
such as for the e-commerce client while developing and designing three different users has to taken care of by our system, one is the customers who would be using the site for whom the site has to be made in such a way that it could handle many dynamic requests and engagement simultaneously as there are several aspects of design which would have to be taken care of at the server side. 

the second users would be the site admins and inside team for whom a product data management , order tracking , security has to be integrated at a enterprise level to ensure a good response.

the third are the B2B partners if there is such a requirement has to taken into consideration - order fulfilment and shipping with third party providers has to be taken care of so that they have easier time with our client and the end to end system has to be perfected.

- media/publishing
while for the media/publishing client the major focus would be on organising and cataloging existing content, including articles, images, videos and other assets. for such clients content creation and curation play a significant role thus the project plan should account for the creation of an editorial calendar that outlines the schedule for publishing new content, including articles, blog posts, and multimedia.

Here as for the user engagement most of the work is cacheable non-blocking I/O tasks such as retrieval of contents from the server to the client side. thus a CMS would be very suitable for such clients. the UI/UX plays a very important part in order to have growing community of users while having the goal of maintaining a good number of daily active users. 


*Which is your favourite article about management? What did you learn from it?*

My favourite article about management is 'Management Time: Whoâ€™s Got the Monkey?' from Harvard Business Review. This article explains about the managerial art of feeding and taking care of the monkeys hoped on the manager's back from his/her subordinate's back. Here the monkeys are simply problems faced by the subordinate which need the manager's help and attention. In the article, 4 different scenarios are explained where 4 subordinates try and drop the monkeys from their back to their managers back and how the manager finds different ways to take care of this monkey. The author explains the different types of monkeys to be taken care of using different scenarios. 

One common monkey is where the subordinate can help themselves but need instructions from the manager to do it. In this case the manager should delegate the task back to the subordinate by defining his/her expectations of the work done within a given time.
Next monkey is also similar but here the subordinate requires some guidance from the manager to complete the task. Here the manager can help the subordinate by understanding what methods the subordinate has already tried and how else he/she can guide the subordinate.
Other monkey is where the subordinate cannot do tasks by himself and needs the manager to think about the solution to the problem. The author suggests the manager to take some time and think about the problem and discuss its solution with the subordinate and take his feedback.

In this way the manager can avoid taking on too many monkeys and free up their time to focus on boss imposed, system imposed as well as have a discretionary time for his/her personal activities.

News and media mein log visits bohut karte hai. Nature of interaction is different. Media clients mein cached results dikha sakte.

[11:21 am, 09/10/2023] Payal: Ki products hai, buy karne hai... Media mein har org ka alag hota hai editorial workflow. Plus revenue models bhi alag hote hai. Media publishing house mein customer engagement important hai ad based revenue drive karne, aur ecommerce mein conversion... The process from adding a product to cart to checkout should be super smooth to convert karne.
