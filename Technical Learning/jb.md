*What aspects of project management will differ for a media/publishing client compared to an e-commerce client?*

Media/publishing clients are typically more focused on the creative aspects of their projects, such as the design, layout, and content. They may also be more concerned with meeting deadlines, as they often have strict editorial calendars thus efficient editorial workflow has to made assured for them so that the publishing process is a seamless experience.

E-commerce clients are typically more focused on the technical aspects of their projects, such as the functionality, performance, and security of their websites. here the speed matters and any latency of a certain limit will distract the user from buying process and user might not convert. thus the website should be able to serve multiple simultaneous dynamic requests with a lesser response time. 

lastly both the parties have different source of revenue for the media client it will mostly be advertisement based revenue model thus ad management  has to be simplified and the ad strategy in such a way that it should not be a distraction for the user. the website should be in a way that it servers responsive ads without losing the user engagement which is I think would be the primary concern for an media/publishing client. 

whereas for the E-commerce clients the revenue model is "product buying" thus for an e-commerce it is important that the overall buying process for the user has to simplified and in such a way that it gets the user to the checkout page (without any technical hurdles) as soon as possible.


*Which is your favourite article about management? What did you learn from it?*

My favourite article about management is 'Management Time: Whoâ€™s Got the Monkey?' from Harvard Business Review. This article explains about the managerial art of feeding and taking care of the monkeys hoped on the manager's back from his/her subordinate's back. Here the monkeys are simply problems faced by the subordinate which need the manager's help and attention. In the article, 4 different scenarios are explained where 4 subordinates try and drop the monkeys from their back to their managers back and how the manager finds different ways to take care of this monkey. The author explains the different types of monkeys to be taken care of using different scenarios. 

One common monkey is where the subordinate can help themselves but need instructions from the manager to do it. In this case the manager should delegate the task back to the subordinate by defining his/her expectations of the work done within a given time.
Next monkey is also similar but here the subordinate requires some guidance from the manager to complete the task. Here the manager can help the subordinate by understanding what methods the subordinate has already tried and how else he/she can guide the subordinate.
Other monkey is where the subordinate cannot do tasks by himself and needs the manager to think about the solution to the problem. The author suggests the manager to take some time and think about the problem and discuss its solution with the subordinate and take his feedback.

In this way the manager can avoid taking on too many monkeys and free up their time to focus on boss imposed, system imposed as well as have a discretionary time for his/her personal activities.
