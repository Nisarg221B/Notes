Many aspects of project management differ for a media/publishing client compared to an ecommerce client. For example, the scope of any project for a media/publishing may be more complex and requires inputs from all of its stakeholders to clearly define the scope whereas the scope for an ecommerce will more often be clearly defined, such as developing a new feature, a new product, or integration of a new system into the existing one. Also the media/publishing client's projects need high degree of creativity, collaboration with different stakeholders and teams, resulting into a high quality content and production. Whereas the ecommerce projects need to be of high quality in terms of design, functionality, performance, scalability and security. 

Managing media/publishing clients more flexibility and adaptability as things might not go according to the plan and adjustments may be needed. Being proactive and communicative is also very important as media/publishing is a creative industry. Apart from this time management is the most important to stay on track and meet deadlines.

Managing ecommerce clients requires more responsiveness and communication via emails and calls. It is important to be proactive and identify problems at an early stage to easily fix it. Being honest and transparent in case of any delay is also crucial for the client. Apart from this being supportive and helpful while answering their questions is very important.


*Which is your favourite article about management? What did you learn from it?*

My favourite article about management is 'Management Time: Whoâ€™s Got the Monkey?' from Harvard Business Review. This article explains about the managerial art of feeding and taking care of the monkeys hoped on the manager's back from his/her subordinate's back. Here the monkeys are simply problems faced by the subordinate which need the manager's help and attention. In the article, 4 different scenarios are explained where 4 subordinates try and drop the monkeys from their back to their managers back and how the manager finds different ways to take care of this monkey. The author explains the different types of monkeys to be taken care of using different scenarios. 

One common monkey is where the subordinate can help themselves but need instructions from the manager to do it. In this case the manager should delegate the task back to the subordinate by defining his/her expectations of the work done within a given time.
Next monkey is also similar but here the subordinate requires some guidance from the manager to complete the task. Here the manager can help the subordinate by understanding what methods the subordinate has already tried and how else he/she can guide the subordinate.
Other monkey is where the subordinate cannot do tasks by himself and needs the manager to think about the solution to the problem. The author suggests the manager to take some time and think about the problem and discuss its solution with the subordinate and take his feedback.

In this way the manager can avoid taking on too many monkeys and free up their time to focus on boss imposed, system imposed as well as have a discretionary time for his/her personal activities.

News and media mein log visits bohut karte hai. Nature of interaction is different. Media clients mein cached results dikha sakte.

[11:21 am, 09/10/2023] Payal: Ki products hai, buy karne hai... Media mein har org ka alag hota hai editorial workflow. Plus revenue models bhi alag hote hai. Media publishing house mein customer engagement important hai ad based revenue drive karne, aur ecommerce mein conversion... The process from adding a product to cart to checkout should be super smooth to convert karne.
