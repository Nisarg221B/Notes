Makes some types of variables accessible/usable in code before they are actually declared. "Variables lifted to the top of their scope".

Before execution, code is scanned for variables declaration, and for each variable , a new property is created in the variable environment object.

if we use a uninitialised variable declared using var we get undefined and not an error which is a very weird behaviour and can cause problems.

so in modern javascript we always use let and const instead of var, where if the uninitialised variable is used we get an error. 

function expressions and arrow functions will behave similar to variables based on how they are declared ( if using var or let/const).
