Asynchronous - Coordinating behavior of a program over a period of time.

- Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the "background" finishes;
- Asynchronous code in non-blocking
- Execution doesn't wait for an asynchronous task to finish its work;
- callback functions alone do NOT make code asynchronous!

**AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript And XML** : allow us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way. With AJAX calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically.

### API 
- Application Programming Interface: Piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other.

There are many types of APIs in web development:
- DOM API
- Geolocation API
- Own Class API
- "Online" API - Applications running on a server, that receives requests for data, and sends data back as response; 
- We can build our own web APIs (eg with node.js) or use 3rd-party APIs.

XML is old and nobody uses it now a days as API data format, we use json


## Promises and Fetch API

**Promise :** An object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation.

- We no longer need to rely on events and callbacks passed into asynchronous functions to handle asynchronous results.
- Instead of nesting callbacks, we can **chain promises** for a sequence of asynchronous operations: **escape callback hell**. 

### The Promise Lifecycle

- Pending
- Settled  ( a Promise is only settled once )
	- Fulfilled
	- Rejected
