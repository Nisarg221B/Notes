#javascript 

Javascript is a high level, prototype based object oriented, multi paradigm, interpreted or just in time complied, dynamic(dynamically typed), single threaded, garbage collected programming language with first class function and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.

#### paradigm :

an approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique

three popular programming paradigm
- procedural programming
- object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Functional programming (FP)

Javascript uses all the above paradigm


#### prototype-based object-oriented

In a language with first class functions, functions are simply treated as variables.
we can pass them into other functions and return them from functions.
  
Non-blocking event loop

- Concurrency Model: how the javascript engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.
	-- JavaScript runs in one single thread, so it can only do one thing at a time.
	--- so what about a long-running task?
	-- Sounds like it would block the single thread. however, we want non-blocking behaviour!
	--- How do we achieve that?
	-- By using an event loop; takes long running tasks, executes them in the "background", and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished.

#### Compilation vs interpretation

Modern Javascript engine use mix between interpretation and compilation

here the machine code is not a portable file and the execution happens immediately.
