### OOP in JS : Prototypes

![[Screenshot 2023-09-08 at 5.22.58 PM.png|500]]

In javascript we have prototypes to which the objects are linked, this prototypes contains methods that are accessible to all the objects linked to that prototype in turn acting like a class and objects acting like a instance.

###### How do we actually create prototypes ? and how do we link objects to prototypes? how can we create new objects, without having classes?

## 3 ways of Implementing Prototypal Inheritance 

##### 1. Constructor functions
- Technique to create objects from a function;
- This is how build in objects like arrays, maps, or set are actually implemented.
##### 2. ES6 Classes
- Modern alternative to constructor function syntax;
- "Syntactic sugar": behind the scenes, ES6 classes work **exactly** like constructor functions;
- ES6 classes do NOT behave like classes in "classical OOP".
##### 3. Object.create()


## Constructor functions


- Constructor function (Person) points to  Prototype using .prototype (Person.prototype) and the Prototype points back to its constructor function using .constructor property.
- The new operator does for things

1. An empty object is created

 2. this keyword in this new object is linked to the construction function. (which in turn will create , name and birthYear property in this blank object as we used this.name = name  and this.birthYear = birthYear).

3. The new Object is linked to the constructor functions prototype property using            \_\_proto__ property ,  \_\_proto__ always points to the prototype object.

4. Finally this new object is returned with all its own properties and methods and the prototype linked to it with the method and properties listed there.


- All the objects instantiated from Constructor function, points to the same prototype property of constructor function from which they where created.

#### Prototype chain 
- Series of link between objects, linked through prototypes.
- ability of looking up methods and property in a prototype

## How Object.Create Works

Used for manually linking a {} empty object to a prototype object (which is also manually created).

it is mainly used to link the prototypes in inheritance between classes.
