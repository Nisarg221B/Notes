### OOP in JS : Prototypes

![[Screenshot 2023-09-08 at 5.22.58 PM.png|500]]

In javascript we have prototypes to which the objects are linked, this prototypes contains methods that are accessible to all the objects linked to that prototype in turn acting like a class and objects acting like a instance.

###### How do we actually create prototypes ? and how do we link objects to prototypes? how can we create new objects, without having classes?

## 3 ways of Implementing Prototypal Inheritance 

##### 1. Constructor functions
- Technique to create objects from a function;
- This is how build in objects like arrays, maps, or set are actually implemented.
##### 2. ES6 Classes
- Modern alternative to constructor function syntax;
- "Syntactic sugar": behind the scenes, ES6 classes work **exactly** like constructor functions;
- ES6 classes do NOT behave like classes in "classical OOP".
##### 3. Object.create()
