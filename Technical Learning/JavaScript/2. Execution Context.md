- One execution context **per function**: for each function call, a new execution context is created.

### Whats inside execution context?

1. Variable Environment
   - let, const , var declarations
   - functions
   - arguments object. (NOT in arrow functions!)

2.  Scope chain (references to variables outside of the current function)
3.  this keyword (NOT in arrow functions! )

now the program stays in this state indefinitely.

The global context is pop of the stack only when the program is really finished which means when the browser tab is closed or execution is interrupted.
