### First class functions ( its a concept )

- Javascript treats functions as first-class citizens
- this means the functions are simply values
- Functions are just another 'type' of object

bind is method of a function.


### Higher order functions 
(Higher order functions exists in practice => you can create higher order functions)

- A function that receives another function as an argument, that returns a new function or both.
- This is only possible because of first-class functions

A callback function is called callback as it will be called by higher order function when needed.
