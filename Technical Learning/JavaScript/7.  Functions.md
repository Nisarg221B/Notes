### First class functions ( its a concept )

- Javascript treats functions as first-class citizens
- this means the functions are simply values
- Functions are just another 'type' of object

bind is method of a function.


### Higher order functions 
(Higher order functions exists in practice => you can create higher order functions)

- A function that receives another function as an argument, that returns a new function or both.
- This is only possible because of first-class functions

A callback function is called callback as it will be called by higher order function when needed.

### Closures

- A function has access to the variable environment (VE) of the execution context in which it was created even after that execution context is gone.
- **Closure**: VE attached to the function, exactly as it was at the time and place the function was created.

```javascript
const secureBooking = function(){
	let passengerCount = 0;

	return function(){
		passengerCount++;
		console.log(`${passengerCount} passengers`);
	};
};

const booker = secureBooking();

```

till the execution of the above code below two stages have been finished

1.  secureBooking is added to the class stack , and its scope is created which references to the global scope

2. now securebooking() execution is finished hence it is poped of the call stack , secureBooking function returned a new function called booker which is then added to the global scope.

```javascript

booker();// 1 passenge4
booker();// 2 passenger
booker();

```

3. now when the broker() is invoked , it is added to the call stack and its scope is created.

4. But you can see that the problem is  that how will the booker function access passengerCount variable , its no where to be found in scope chain.

5. the secret is that any function has access to the  variable environment of the execution context in which the function was created. In case of booker it was created in execution context of secureBooking(), thus it gets access to the variable environment of secureBooking.

6. and this is how the booker function will able to read and manipulate the passengerCount variable.
-  and its this connection which we call closure.
- this connection is maintained even after the execution context is pop off the stack.
- the closure has priority over scope chain.

- you can see that even after the execution context of booker is poped off the stack , passenger count closure is still attached to the function.
