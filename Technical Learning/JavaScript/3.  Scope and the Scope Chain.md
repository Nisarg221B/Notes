 
- **Scoping** - How our program's variables are organised and accessed.
- **Lexical Scoping** - Scoping is controlled by placement of functions and blocks in the code.
- **Scope** - Space or environment in which a certain variable is declared(variable environment in case of functions). There is global scope, function scope, and block scope.
- **Scope of a variable** - Region of  our code where a certain variable can be accessed.

### Scope Chain

- variables are looked up in the outer scopes (note that they are not copied).

- You can observe block scope of 'if' in first() contains only decade which is a const, and the millennial which was var and thus a function scope is present in the first() scope thus can also be accessed from second() function or second() scope.
- if block scope and second() scope are sibling scope and thus due to their placement or more technically due to lexical scoping they cannot access any variables for each-others scope. 
- function declarations has block scope in strict mode and function scope otherwise
