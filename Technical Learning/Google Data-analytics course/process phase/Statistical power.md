The probability of getting meaningful results from a test.

[A Gentle Introduction to Statistical Power and Power Analysis in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-power-and-power-analysis-in-python/ "A Gentle Introduction to Statistical Power and Power Analysis") sums it up nicely:

"**Statistical power** can be calculated and reported for a completed experiment to comment on the confidence one might have in the conclusions drawn from the results of the study. It can also be used as a tool to estimate the number of observations or sample size required in order to detect an effect in an experiment."

**Statistically Significant** is a term used in statistics.

if a test is statistically significant , it means that its results are real and not an error caused by random chance. Usually you need a statistical power of at least 0.8 or 80% to consider your results statistically significant.
