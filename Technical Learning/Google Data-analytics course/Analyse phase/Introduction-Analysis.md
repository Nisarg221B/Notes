## The 4 Phase of analysis

1. Organise data
2. Format and adjust data
3. Get input from others
4. Transform data

## Organising the data

**Sorting** and **filtering** are two ways you can keep things organised when you format and adjust data to work with it. For example, a filter can help you find errors or outliers so you can fix or flag them before your analysis.
