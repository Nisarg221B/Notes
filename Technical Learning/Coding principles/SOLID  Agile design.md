## Introduction

- good code is perfectly obvious
	- If you modify something and it breaks its a bad code.

- **Rigid code** is a code that has dependencies that snake out in so many directions that you cannot make an isolated change without changing everything else around it.( bad dependencies, systems that are coupled )

another symptom of bad code similar to that one is called fragility

- **Fragility** is the tendency of the code to break in many places even when you only
change it in one place. you make one very simple change and a whole bunch of other things break but they break in parts of the codes that have no relationship to what you changed. 


The common thread here is coupling dependency.
