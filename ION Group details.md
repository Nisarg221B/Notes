Suggestions I thought of while reading

- if they have acquired so many companies some of them must have few intersecting or same functions - its better to group the companies bought and form few independent and international ( it might be the case that the companies aquired may have similar functions but for different countries ) softwares to void confusions and make it streamline for multinational clients and also make it easier for domestic clients.
