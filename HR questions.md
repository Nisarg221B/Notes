1. Introduction 


2. Why do you want to work with us ? 

First of all I love to work with data and getting the gist of the story the data is trying telling and its implication is my passion plus  I believe I possess the necessary skills to be an asset to the organization and of course there's no stop to learning and for which I know that there's nothing better than being a part of Ionâ€™s expert team to understand the data and its implications at its core and the business around it.

Secondly I am very interested in the future of finance and banking sector with the outbreaks of advance technologies at hand , here I think ION will be a perfect place as majority of the innovations around tech in finance involves ION ( whether it is forex or platforms for trading in equity market or market or data analyses or treasury management). ( like fidessa , wall street system , dash etc)

3. Which location do you prefer and why

I would prefer pune first as its very near to my home state + its very convenient for me to visit my parents if need be. second is delhi gurugram as it has really powerful vibes and I strive in it.
