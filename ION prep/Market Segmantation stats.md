Data analyst swara
 - there was a issue where the agencys customer base was decreasing and a solid reason was not to be found because of lack of structure on how the company was addressing this issue. When I was hired as a data analyst I tried to get to the root cause of the problem.
 - was it because of agencys after sales service or was it because of some external factor or the inefficiency of the sales dept or people prefered different product.
