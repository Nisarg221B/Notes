Introduction 
- Hook (Generalization, anecdote, interesting fact, trend, quote, etc)
	- Introduces the topic (nothing more): don’t write your thesis or supporting idea here!
- Shift to prompt
	- Makes your essay more cohesive(make it flow better); an abrupt shift to your thesis is awkward
- Thesis (most important part of the essay…by far)
	- This baby is the boss that controls everything. The thesis you choose exists on a spectrum(strongly agree, mostly agree, neutral, mostly disagree, strongly disagree)
	- Greg recommends “mostly agree” or “mostly disagree”
- Outline (tells you reader how you’re going to structure your essay)
	- Don’t neglect this bad boy; academic readers like to know what’s coming(how many reasons/examples)

Body Paragraph (two of them)
- Topic sentence that introduces your first reason that supports your thesis
	- It is imperative that this introduces the overall idea of the paragraph (the “controlling” idea) and that it supports your thesis. The topic is a mini thesis
- Example 
	- You need a good example here, preferably from history, politics, economics etc
	- If you can’t think of one, use a good hypothetical 
	- No one wants to hear about Uncle Bob
- Example 2(Optional) - Counter example
	- All the same rules apply
	- Discourages “story telling”
	- Development/Explanation
- You need to develop your idea. You need to connect the reason to the thesis. You need to explain why this matters
	- 2-3 sentence of development is good enough
- Remember there are 2 of these!

Concession Paragraph (counterpoint)
- Topic sentence that introduces a counterpoint to your thesis
- Remember this is why we "mostly" agreed or disagreed. It leaves room for nuance.
- Example 
	- Same rules apply
- Optional) Example 2
	- Same rules apply
	- Development/Explanation 

Conclusion
- Doesn't actually matter much. I mean you need it. It can't not exist.
- But all you want to do is rephrase your thesis and your supporting ideas and wrap this baby up.
