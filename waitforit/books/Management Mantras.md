Many people do not want to work under someone else, be it in their personal sphere, as an employee in a company or even as a volunteer. They have the notion that when they work under someone, they lose their freedom and have to be accountable. Thus, many people opt to run a business of their own, wanting to be their own boss. But even if you have your own business, you are answerable to so many people. If you cannot be accountable to even one person, how can you be accountable to many? This is the paradox. In fact, having your own business binds you more than having a boss does! Refusing to work under someone is a sign of weakness and not strength. A strong person will feel comfortable working under anyone. This is because he knows his strength. It is the weak and poor in spirit who do not like to work under someone else because they are unaware of their own strength. They cannot be successful in business or in any profession. — location: [303]()

You have no escape from love. Really. You are made up of a substance called love. If you are angry, it is because of love. You love perfection, and so you are angry at imperfection. When love gets distorted, it becomes anger. When love gets fermented, it becomes hatred. Your love for objects becomes greed. You love someone so much, that it becomes possessiveness and then it creates jealousy. Perhaps the world would have been a better place without love because of all these negative imperfections. In fact, love is the mother of all lawyers. If there were no love, then law as a profession would not survive. All negative emotions are nothing but distortions of love. I do not think love is an emotion that would make you say, "Oh my dear, I can't live without you, I want you to sit next to me all the time." Love is really what we are, it is our very existence, our whole life. But the way we express it, what we do out of love is a different thing. That needs wisdom. — location: [1107]()

The lazy have all the time, the un-intelligent have no time and the intelligent will make time. It is the same 24 hours in a day, whether for a clerk in a bank or for the Prime Minister. — location: [1247]()

We should know that it is the restlessness in us that makes us feel that we are short of time. If you are relaxed and if you are intuitive, then you will find that you have all the time, that you can make time, you can do it. Just that bit of confidence in your mind will let you find time when you need it most. — location: [1248]()
